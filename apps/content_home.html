Here are the apps that I have developed spending a few hours a day over the last 2 years. They are all related to interests of mine: <ul><li>Statistics</li><li>Algorithms</li><li>Programming</li><li>Artificial Intelligence (mainly Game Theory, Data Mining)</li><li>Football(Soccer)</li><li>Squash</li><li>Chess</li> <li>Trivia</li> </ul><h1>When did I start?</h1><p>Started learning iOS development 1st Jan 2014.</p><p>Started learning Android development 24th Jan 2015.</p><h1>What do I do it on?</h1>Mac Book Pro, yes including the Android development. <h1>Where do I do it?</h1><p>Mainly on my daily commute to and from work on the Toronto subway, an average of 45 minutes each way and 1 hour at home. A few hours on the weekend. I have a full time job, and no it is not as a mobile application developer. I know, It's not ideal learning and programming for mobile apps for 2 and half hours split over 3 sessions in a day. It's like building a house one brick at a time... but eventually it does get built :-) <h1>Why do I do it?</h1>Like programming, get to combine a lot of my interests like AI, Trivia, Football, Stats into one app. Cool to see the app being used in various parts of the world. I am probably one of the biggest users of my apps. All apps I have written (so far) will also work in offline/airplane mode.<h1>Have I got rich doing it?</h1>No :-). Most of the apps are free. I have been writing apps that I myself am really eager to use, maybe they are not that useful or appealing to the masses. Writing what you are interested in is a good way to keep one motivated (remember the one brick at a time I mentioned earlier!). Also there is no marketing effort in these apart from a  mention on my personal Facebook page to friends and relatives. Can see some stats on the 'Numbers' page.     <br></div></body></html>
